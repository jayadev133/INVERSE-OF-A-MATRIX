# INVERSE-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the inverse of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
### Step1 : In your Python script, import the NumPy library.
### Step 2: Define the matrix for which you want to find the inverse.
### Step 3:  Define the Matrix
### Step 4:  Find the Inverse

## Program:
```
#Program to find the inverse of a matrix.
#Developed by: 
#RegisterNumber:
import numpy as np
a=[[6,2,3],[3,1,1],[10,3,4]]
b=np.linalg.inv(a)
print(b)
```
